            I don't know why. But now, the Korean keyboard isn't working. So I have to write down my story in English.
            Today, for the first time, we have came here, SNU station bcs of the participation in Springcamp. today, the work process has been quite nice. Won-suk, Jung-ryeol, Yuju and I just had lunch together. and
            the mood was not so bad. Walking outside btw work is so useful and cheering. Even though I will not stay here for so long, my dream for staying miscellaneous places by working has been come true.
            I think that it will be much useful to me that just writing down my day-plan before starting my day officially.
            By doing so, I can complete the healthy and accessible plan for one day. It is the true starting point for my career.
            I think that the pre-disciplined scheme always make the desirable goals come true, in spite of some unexpectable obstacles.
            Doing some Yoga will also reduce some possibilities, which are gnawing my life basement slowly.
            Anyway, I will have some memo on web from now on as frequent as possible.
            hmm... in English, it is somewhat akward...;;;
